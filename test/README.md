Unit test and integration test for NetPolValidator tool:


Unit Tests: 
For unit tests, we'll use the Go testing package along with a mocking library like gomock or testify. We'll create tests for the methods in PolicyValidator. Use the testify library for assertions, which provides a more expressive syntax. The unit tests mock Kubernetes client interactions using fake.Clientset.


Integration Tests:
For integration tests, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster or a local setup like Minikube or KinD. The following test assumes you have access to a cluster where you can create resources. These tests require a running Kubernetes cluster. Adjust the kubeconfig path and ensure your cluster is accessible. You may need to handle resource cleanup in real scenarios to avoid conflicts.
